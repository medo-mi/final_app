      <p>All people with CF require close and regular evaluation
          of growth, nutritional status and body composition
          throughout their lives. Reliable and sequential
          measurements of growth and nutritional status are an
          essential part of the clinical assessment of health status
          in CF. Regular assessment will help to ensure that any
          deterioration in nutritional status is detected early, so
          that nutrition interventions can be initiated.
